# rataccessibleregions
Regions of the rat genome that we think have low-confidence because of high heterozygosity and should be masked while analysing this genome.
The coordinates correspond to the RN6 reference genome.

ACI_BN_BU_F3_M5_MR_WK_WN_intersect.bed contains genomic segments which we label as low-confidence. These are low-confidence regions in all 8 inbred founder strains.
