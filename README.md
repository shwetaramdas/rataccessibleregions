# README

In this respository, we provide a mask for regions of the rat genome that show unusually high heterozygosity. We suggest that they be masked while performing genomic analysis on the rat rn6 genome.
The coordinates correspond to the rn6 reference genome.

The subfolder merged/ contains recommended mask files.

The subfolder unmerged/ contains mask files created without merging segments separated by a single window of low-heterozygosity.

Methods to generate these described in: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/29/332932.1
